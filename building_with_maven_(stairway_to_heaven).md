# Building with Maven (On LedZeppelin's Stairway to heaven song)

There's a lady who's sure that her fingers are gold\
And she's building her code with maven\
When she get, when she posts, when she starts all the clones\
With a curl she can grep what she search for\
Oohhh Ooohhh, and she's building her code with maven...

There's some post-it on walls, but she wants to be sure\
Cauz' you know, sometimes specs have no meanings\
...
